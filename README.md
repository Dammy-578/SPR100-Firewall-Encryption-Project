# Network Traffic Filtering & Email Encryption – SPR100 Project

**Course:** SPR100 – Introduction to Security  
**Date:** October 2024  
**Institution:** Seneca Polytechnic

## 🧠 Overview
This project demonstrates how to configure a Linux firewall using `nftables` and apply basic encryption principles through email encryption and digital signatures using OpenPGP Studio.

---

## 🔐 Firewall Tasks (Part 1)
- Enabled and configured the `nftables` firewall on Ubuntu
- Created an `inet filter` table with input and output chains
- Blocked HTTP traffic to simulate web restrictions
- Blocked ICMP (ping) traffic from host to VM
- Verified rules using `nft list table` and real-time traffic testing

---

## ✉️ Encryption Tasks (Part 2)
- Used OpenPGP Studio to generate a public/private key pair
- Sent an encrypted and digitally signed email from Seneca email to the instructor
- Demonstrated digital signatures and secure message delivery

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- nftables (Linux firewall)
- Network traffic filtering (ICMP, HTTP)
- Email encryption & digital signing (OpenPGP)
- Ubuntu CLI & system configuration
